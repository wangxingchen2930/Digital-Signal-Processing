# Laplace Transform and Z Transform

# Laplace transform

convert the continuous signals (which don't satisfy Dirichlet conditions) to finite before apply Fourier transform

# Z transform

convert the discrete signals (which don't satisfy Dirichlet conditions) to finite before apply discrete time Fourier transform
